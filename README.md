## Reflection

### Day 1

Not a bad start to advent, feel like using Regex may not have been the smartest approach due to overlapping strings but it got the solution pretty quick and without too much jank!

### Day 2

Love when the example and input don't give the same answer 😖

Otherwise pretty easy day with a moderately annoying input to parse

### Day 3

Oh boy.

Made so many silly mistakes today, first 'grid' style problem and was getting destroyed by end of lines. Pretty happy with the approach and implementation of a simplistic Part 2 but way too much time spent bothering friends to help debug! 🐛

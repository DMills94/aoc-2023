## Reflection

### Day 1

Not a bad start to advent, feel like using Regex may not have been the smartest approach due to overlapping strings but it got the solution pretty quick and without too much jank!

### Day 2

Love when the example and input don't give the same answer 😖

Otherwise pretty easy day with a moderately annoying input to parse

### Day 3

Oh boy.

Made so many silly mistakes today, first 'grid' style problem and was getting destroyed by end of lines. Pretty happy with the approach and implementation of a simplistic Part 2 but way too much time spent bothering friends to help debug! 🐛

### Day 4

A nice change of pace, both answers first time and only took about 30 minutes! 😁

Was nice to utilise a common function to parse each card into an object, then a simple iteration over each to produce a solution. Good win!

### Day 5

Interesting day! Crazy input, ran out of JS memory multiple times but after a 23 minute runtime we got the right answer first try for Part 2 and i'm calling that a victory 🎉
